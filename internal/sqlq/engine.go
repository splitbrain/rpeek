// Package sqlq is rpeek's read-only query language: a small, SQL-looking grammar that is
// not SQL. Its front end (lexer, parser) is hand-rolled and depends only on the standard
// library; its back end translates the parsed query into a real SQL SELECT with a
// multi-dialect query builder. Read-only is a property of the grammar rather than a check:
// there is no production that emits a write, so a write is a syntax error, unrepresentable
// on any account. Client identifiers are validated and resolved against the live catalog
// and handed to the builder as quoted identifiers; client values are always bound as
// parameters. No client token ever reaches the SQL string as text.
package sqlq

// Engine identifies a database engine, selecting the query builder dialect and the
// catalog-introspection queries used to resolve identifiers.
